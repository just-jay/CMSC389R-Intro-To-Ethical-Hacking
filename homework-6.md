<h2>Homework #6</h2>
  
Setup: I started by downloading the requisite fpff file and the python stub to develop.

---

Part 1: I read through the stub, as well as the provided resources on fpff. 
I used the provided stub to write a parser for the fpff file format. It is included in this repository and can be found here: //ADD A LINK TO THE CODE

Via the code I wrote and used I found the follwoing:

1) foo.fpff has a unix timestamp of 1056472735, which when converted becomes Tuesday, June 24, 2003 12:38:55 PM (according to my current time zone)
2) The author of the the file is mnthomp
3) The file says it has 9 sections.
4) My code returned teh output below
``` -------  BODY  -------
1 [SECTION_ASCII (0x1)]
('i love leaving restaurant reviews!',)
2 [SECTION_WORDS (0x3) -- Array of words]
(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9)
3 [SECTION_COORD (0x6) -- (Latitude, longitude) tuple of doubles.]
(25.291332, -80.3809373)
4 [SECTION_REFERENCE (0x7) -- The index of another section.]
section ref: 1
5 [SECTION_ASCII (0x1)]
("i wonder when they'll fix their sign?",)
6 [SECTION_ASCII (0x1)]
('i heard their naan is always fresh',)
7 [SECTION_COORD (0x6) -- (Latitude, longitude) tuple of doubles.]
(38.9910941, -76.9328019)
8 [SECTION_PNG (0x8) -- Embedded PNG image.]
File Created: resultsfile.png
9 [SECTION_ASCII (0x1)]
('NF2CO4ZANRUWWZJAMEQGMYLDORXXE6JMEBRHK5BAMZXXEIDGN5XWIIIK',)```
