Part 2: 
For part 2, I satrted by looking for a website to encrypt something with a PGP key, and I conveniently found this: https://www.igolder.com/pgp/encryption/. I then entered the public key that was included for us, and my message that i was going to encrypt (I chose the first paragraph from Harry Potter): `Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.`
